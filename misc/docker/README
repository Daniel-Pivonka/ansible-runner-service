Running ansible-runner-service in a container

Purpose: provide a container version of the ansible runner service running in
'prod' mode

The container runs ansible runner service with bind mounts out to the local filesystem
to provide runtime, playbooks and artifacts persistence. This approach allows you to
install an rpm containing the playbooks specific to ceph or gluster, then map these
through to the Container.


Requirements
1. create an archive of the project called ansible-runner-service.tar.gz and
store it in the misc/docker directory
2. set up you local environment to persist the config
 mkdir /etc/ansible-runner-service
 mkdir /usr/share/ansible-runner-service
 cp ~paul/git/ansible-runner-service/{logging,config}.yaml /etc/ansible-runner-service/.
 cp -r ~paul/git/ansible-runner-service/samples/* /usr/share/ansible-runner-service/

Building (as root)
cd misc/docker
docker build -f Dockerfile -t runner-service .

Running the container
basic - no persistence
docker run -d --network=host -p 5001:5001/tcp --name runner-service runner-service

with persistence
docker run -d --network=host -p 5001:5001/tcp -v /usr/share/ansible-runner-service:/usr/share/ansible-runner-service -v /etc/ansible-runner-service:/etc/ansible-runner-service --name runner-service runner-service

May need bind mounts for
/etc/ansible/hosts ... to persist hosts and groups
/root/.ssh ... to perists ssh key access for passwordless ssh
/etc/ansible-runner-service ... for the logging and runtime configuration overrides
/usr/share/ansible-runner-service ... for the playbooks, artifacts and roles
